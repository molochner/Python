# Python-Encrypter-Decrypter
(I would love feedback and/or advise)

Encrypt a file and get a key to decrypt that file, or decrypt a file using an existing key.

# Encryption:
  1. The script will create a completely random key (just a string of unique characters)
  2. Choose a file (.txt) to encrypt
  3. Each character in your file will change to the character at the corresponding key spot
  4. The encryption will be saved into a different file named 'yourfilename'_encoded.'yourfiletype'
  5. The key will be saved into a file named 'yourfilename'_decryption_key.'yourfiletype'
  
# Decryption:
  1. Choose your file to be decrypted
  2. Choose the key corresponding to your encrypted file
  3. The decryption will be saved into a file named 'yourfilename'_decoded.'yourfiletype'
